In the instructions pane on the left (where you're reading this text) are the instructions for each step of each scenario.
Follow the instructions to complete the scenario.

## Executing Commands

Occasionally you'll see an executable command with a little arrow on the right, such as:

``echo 'Hello World!'``{{execute}}

You can manually type this command into the terminal on the right, or you can
click the command itself to automatically copy and paste and execute
the command in the terminal (which is a fully functional Linux terminal!)

## Links

Links are [highlighted](http://redhat.com) and can be clicked to open
a separate tab in your browser. You can then continue the scenario by returning to this tab (be sure not to close it!)

## Terminal Tabs

On the right, you'll see a set of tabs:

![Instructions](/redhat-middleware-workshops/assets/getting-started/tabs.png)

These tabs are quick links for you to use:

* **Terminal** - This tab is always present and is the main terminal into which you will type Linux commands like `ls` and others.
* **Local Web Browser** - This tab will open a new tab in your browser and give you access to programs running on HTTP port 8080 in your environment. This is used to
do testing of applications that run outside of OpenShift. You'll use this later on.
* **OpenShift Console** - This tab will open a new tab in your browser pointing to the OpenShift Web Console. You will use throughout
the workshop.
* **The Plus(+) Button** - This is used to open new Terminals and view applications running on other ports. You won't need to use this during the
workshop but it's useful if you want to run another command in a separate terminal.

## Opening files

You may also encounter instructions that ask you to open a file in the
editor, and be provided a link such as this one: `hello.txt`{{open}}. Clicking
on the filename will open the file's content into the editor at the upper right,
and you can edit the file right away.

## Editing code

The code editor at the upper right is a fully functional text-based
editor for editing code. You can edit the code directly in the window and your
changes will automatically be saved. Occasionally you may encounter code
snippets with a **Copy to Editor** link, such as:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./hello.txt" data-target="replace">
This is code that I can copy and paste without having to type it in!
</pre>

These snippets save you time by writing code for you, but you're always encouraged
to try and type the code in yourself where it makes sense and doesn't take too much
time.
