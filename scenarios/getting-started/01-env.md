This workshop is split into several _scenarios_, each of which focuses on a specific
area related to Application Modernization and Transformation with Red Hat technologies.

Each scenario in turn has a number of steps that you follow to complete the scenario in the
order shown on the front page.

from the beginning by simply reloading your browser's page.

As you complete each step within a scenario, click the **Continue** button to move on to the next
