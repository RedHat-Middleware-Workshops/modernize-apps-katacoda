As modern application requirements become more complex, it’s apparent that one runtime, one
framework, or one architectural style is no longer a feasible strategy. Organizations must figure out how
to manage the complexity of distributed app development with diverse technologies, a lack of skilled
resources, and siloed processes.

In this hands-on workshop you’ll learn about:

* Migrating an existing legacy Java™ EE app to [Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview/) on [OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/).
* Using modern frameworks like [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Wildfly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io),
[Eclipse Vert.x](http://vertx.io), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to implement microservices and
replace monolithic functionality.
* Developing and deploying using [Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/), [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar/overview/), and
DevOps processes.
* The benefits and challenges with microservices, including use
cases for reactive microservices.
* Preventing and detecting issues in a distributed system.
* API gateways and microservices.
